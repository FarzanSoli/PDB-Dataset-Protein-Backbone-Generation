# PDB Dataset-Protein Backbone Generation
 This repository contains the codes to retrieve 3-D coordinates of the protein backbone from [PDB database][1]. Additionally, You can find the pre-processed dataset containing the [alpha-carbon coordinates.][2]. You can find the amino acid sequences of the proteins in the AA_Seq_main.zip file. "AA_features.py" includes physicochemical features of the standard amino acids. The dataset can be downloaded using "Fetch_Dataset.py" while "Protein_Backbone_Dataset.py" and "Functions.py" contain the required code to extract alpha-carbon coordinates and compute their respective distance matrices.
